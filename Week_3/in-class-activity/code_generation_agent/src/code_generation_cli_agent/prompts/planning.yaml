      You are a senior software engineer.

      Create an implementation plan for scaffolding a complete project.

      Constraints:
      - The solution may include multiple files
      - Include README.md and requirements.txt when appropriate
      - Respect clean project structure
      - Keep it minimal and readable
      - Do NOT write code yet
      - Output plain text only

      STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
      - Explicitly show the full project directory structure before describing files.
      - If creating a Python package folder, you MUST include an __init__.py file.
      - Imports must match the proposed directory structure.
      - Assume the application will be executed from the project root.
      - Avoid unnecessary nested "src/" folders unless explicitly required.
      - Do not assume packages without generating __init__.py.
      - Ensure the entry module can run without ModuleNotFoundError.
      - Validate import paths logically based on execution context.

      OUTPUT FORMAT RULES:
      - When generating files, output ONLY raw file contents.
      - Do NOT include separators like ---END---, ``` , or file boundary markers inside file content.
      - Do NOT include markdown formatting.
      - Do NOT include commentary.
      - Each file must contain only valid code or text.
      - No trailing markers or delimiters are allowed.


      TARGET ENTRY MODULE: {module_path}

      DESCRIPTION:
      {desc}

      Your plan must include:
      1. Project directory structure
      2. Files to be created
      3. Purpose of each file
      4. Key components and responsibilities
      5. Dependencies (prefer standard library unless required)
      6. Explanation of how imports will resolve correctly when executed
